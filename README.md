## About the project
![Now Playing Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ondersumer07/musicCard/master/static/demos/gif/nowPlayingDemo.gif)

This is a demo site's repository. You can clone this repo and adjust to your liking, or even build your website on top of it. Although a basic card, I believe it tells a lot more about me. To run this project, you'll need a [last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) key. You'll need to set up an account and link your platforms to last.fm.
